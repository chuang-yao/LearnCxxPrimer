# CxxPrimer - Reading Notes

This project contains examples/quizes in C++ Primer (5th Edition).

My learning experience with this Book boils down to:

Chapter 01 - Getting Started  
Chapter 02 - A  
Chapter 03 - B, and how B works with A  
Chapter 04 - C, and how C works with A and B  
Chapter 05 - D, and how D works with A, B, and C  
Chapter 06 - E, and how E works with A, B, C, and D  
...  
Chapter 16 - O, and how O works with A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N
...  

I have read through template argument deduction couple of times.
I am starting to think I am a goldfish.
